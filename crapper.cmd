@echo off
rem Run the CRAP tool on Windows, creating a local virtualenv on first use.
rem The venv comes from py -3, or from python when the py launcher is missing.
rem It counts as made only once it imports crapper, so an install cut short is
rem made again. A failed install removes .venv only when this run made it.
rem UTF-8 mode lets output sent to a file or a pipe hold characters outside the
rem Windows code page, such as the minus sign in the help's formula.
